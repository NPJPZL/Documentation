Here we are documenting our work till we get to our final product.

We started off by finding a project that fits our requirements which where something that is related to a smart home.
We thought about a few projects that could fit. But in the end we settled for a sensor network that monitors temperature and humidity. And is also upgradeable, if you need to use other sensors. The system also runs on batteries so there is no need for a power outlet.
The reasoning behind it is that you can prove to your landlord that you are not responsibile if there is mold in your flat.

Zoe started the project by designing the PCB for the sensors. She designed two PCB desings one of which is a little more pleasing for the eye but both are working.
